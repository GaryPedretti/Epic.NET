To install these templates in MonoDevelop copy them in the proper Data directory
(see http://monodevelop.com/Developers/Articles/User_Profiles).

The location is dependent on operating system and environment, but normally 
will have the following values:

Mac                 ~/Library/MonoDevelop-{version}/Snippets/
Windows Vista/7     ~/AppData/Roaming/MonoDevelop-{version}/Snippets/
Linux               ~/.local/share/MonoDevelop-{version}/Snippets/
