To install these snippets in VisualStudio you can copy them in the proper directory
(see http://snippetlibcsharp.codeplex.com/).

The location is dependent on the version you use  but normally 
will have the following value:

    %HOME%\Documents\Visual Studio {version}\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets
