<h2 id="_nothing_but_business">Nothing but business</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the foreword of Evans' book, Martin Fowler stated:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="content">There are many things that make software development complex.
But the heart of this complexity is the essential intricacy of the problem
domain itself. If you&#8217;re trying to add automation to complicated human
enterprise, than your software cannot dodge this complexity&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all it can do is
control it.</div>

<em>Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans (2003)</em><br />
&#8212; Martin Fowler
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These words grasp the simple rationale for Epic.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When we face a complex enterprise business, we should rapidly realize that everything
we know about software architectures, development techniques, large scale
integration and so, is just a detail.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Our customer will pay us to solve his own problems.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>He don&#8217;t want to know about agility, software integration, CAP theorems,
cloud computing, data security or computational complexity: these are
technicalities that he would avoid at all. These are our problems!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Enterprise customers pay us to get a competitive advantage by solving well
known problems of their own. They don&#8217;t want new, unknown, problems to pay us
for!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Nevertheless, even as "hands on" modelers, we often undervalue their "human"
problems.
Whenever we adapt the models of our customer&#8217;s problem domain to our existing
frameworks, we are mixing two order of complexities: business rules and
technological constraints.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"I don&#8217;t fight my framework!" you would say. Evans explicitly wrote that we
should not. Actually, most of the times it is the wisest choice.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But what if you had a framework that hasn&#8217;t to be fought? What if you could
easily adapt any infrastructure to clean models that capture the
business processes only?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What if we could simply code nothing but business?</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_a_dependency_inversion">A dependency inversion</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In 2004 the European Union issued the Markets in Financial Instruments
Directive (also known as MiFID). The main objectives of the directive
were to increase competition and consumer protection in investment services.
Suddenly many big banks all over the europe begun to adapt their advisory
softwares.
Many software companies (and consulting firms) clashed with a complex
legislation to rule existing business processes, in an heterogeneous set of
technological environments.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Four years later the European Union amended the directive, already adopted
by many states, variously changing the rules.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We soon realized that it was a strategic point to keep the domain fully
indipendent from the infrastructural choises that each bank would had taken.
Moreover the problem was too complex to take technological compromises.
We had to protect the model as the most important asset in our stack.
We had to base our entire stack on the domain model itself, adapting
everything else.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But unfortunately, Epic did not exist.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_epic">What is Epic?</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After a long climb towards trials, failures and insights, we realized a set of
modeling patterns and practices that works very well together against complex
domains.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We took so much confidence in such patterns, that when we now see problems in
their adoption, we often start a new whirpool to get a deeper insight of the
context. Such process often shows a misunderstanding in the domain language.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At the core, Epic is a coherent set of modeling patterns, best practices
and lessons learned (with a lots of anti-patterns to avoid: did you know that
lazy loading and event brokers are among our new singletons?).</p></div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_more_than_theories">More than theories</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you will see, some of the patterns we propose are really challenging from
a technological point of view.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If not taken together as a whole, they could seem impossible to implement.
Actually, they <strong>are</strong> impossible to implement (correctly) if mixed with those we
propose as anti-patterns. We learned this the hard way.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So what?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Well, Epic is more than a set of coherent patterns: we designed a framework and
a set of tools to inject the infrastructure into the domain model itself,
without any need to adapt it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Epic will help you to</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
reduce the effort to code and maintain the model implementation
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
enforce the aderence to patterns (if you want to)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
adapt the infrastructure you need to the model itself (persistence, caching
  and so on will be orthogonal to the modeling code)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
build complex, beautiful and highly interactive user-interfaces
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
follow a simple, predictable and traceable development process, that
  could become very fast, thanks to its parallelization&#8217;s capabilities
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
minimize the effects of infrastructural changes on the application reliability
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_all_that_glitters_ain_8217_t_gold">All that glitters ain&#8217;t gold!</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Epic will never help you to cut modeling hours. On the contrary, you should
invest a lot on them! Whenever you have any doubt about the business, stop
coding, kidnap the domain expert and start a new exploration whirpool.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Moreover, it require high skills in object oriented design. Such skills are
rather expensive to acquire and thus building a productive team using Epic will
require budget. As a conseguence Epic will minimize the development efforts
and maximize the software quality (cutting maintenance&#8217;s costs), but will not
reduce the budgets required.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Keep this in mind: Epic could overwhelm simple projects!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Avoid Epic (and domain driven design) when you do not have complex business
rules and do not require high reliability while sticking to such rules.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_structure_of_this_manual">The structure of this manual</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first part of the manual introduce patterns and practices to ease
design, development and evolution of the domain model itself.
It is mostly written for "hands on" modelers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The second part document the various components of the Epic framework.
It&#8217;s designed for the full development team (from DBA to GUI designers).</p></div>
