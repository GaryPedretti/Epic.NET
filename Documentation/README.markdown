The Epic Documentation
======================

These are the [Epic.NET][1] documentation sources. 
To download the documentation in HTML, PDF or EPUB, see the project's 
[documentation page][2].

Use a simple text editor, such as JEdit, to edit the source files.
The documentation is written with [Asciidoc][3] an open source tool used by
O'Reilly's authors.

The original and master language is English, hence the "en-US" subdirectory
is authorative.

How to get it
-------------
Check out a copy of Epic.NET from the repository. A regular
Epic.NET download will not contain the sources for the
documentation, only the PDF/EPUB/HTML output, use the repository!
