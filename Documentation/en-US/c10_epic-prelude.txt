Epic.Prelude
---------
The Epic.Prelude can be thought of as a preface for your domain model. 
It provides a set of general purpose models distilled from our experience. 

Indeed during some years of work in domain driven design we faced many different
domains but we have found some common concepts in them
(most of which are rooted in theorethical math). After some trials and errors we 
realized an acceptable design that is proposed in this module.

NOTE: You could object that while one of the core design targets of Epic is to 
keep the domain model ignorant of the infrastructure, Epic.Prelude 
imposes a dependency from Epic itself. It's right!
You should carefully consider pro and cons of such dependency.
However, since the Epic.Prelude models are actually usefull we decided to 
provide them.

WARNING: From a legal point of view, by referencing Epic.Prelude, your 
domain model will be subjected to the licencing terms with which you obtained 
Epic. In other words, if you obtained Epic under the 
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html[Affero GPLv3], 
your whole domain must be distributed under the terms of such a license. 
Note however that, this is already true for the rest of the application build 
with Epic. mailto:giacomo@tesio.it[Contact the authors] to obtain 
a linking exception if you want to write proprietary code.
