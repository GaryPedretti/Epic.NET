Toward a shared modeling grammar
================================

I can clearly remember when I first faced with a corporate software project.

Unlike my previous development experiences, the business was so complex that 
I wasn't able to grasp it. I carefully read the project's documentation, but 
still I wasn't able to truly understand the application.
Most of the documentation was about financial assets, cash flow management, 
fund switches, bank's commissions. 
Nothing about databases or tiers, just a few informations about 
an old order routing system.

I felt lost. I was missing the overall vision.

A *simple* overall vision is the foundation of any architecture.

When we got the first frustrations due to misunderstandings between the 
customer and the team, I realized that we didn't speak the same language. 
Indeed, we had high level functional specifications, 
written by lawyers and financial experts that gave a lot for granted 
while leaving aside many edge cases.

Understanding the problem, led to the solution: we revised the concept of 
"ubiquitous language" and we switched to a truly domain driven approach.

We are talking about a project that took four years to complete. Three 
teams of five people worked hard on the different modules of the application
(CRM, portfolio management, advisory and so). As you can guess, we had 
different changes of specifications over time, becouse the consultants had lots 
of second thoughts about the customer's business processes.

Nevertheless, despite the initial panic, the project was a success.

Such a good result derived from these high-skilled teams, a bunch of smart 
people who daily shared (and discussed) their own experiences. 

We had our vision: the domain model was the *heart* of our 
application, the asset to protect and to depend upon.

Going beyond the initial knowledge base, we developed a 
set of patterns that help us to design and implement the ubiquitous language in 
a predictable amount of time. The patterns worked like a shared modeling 
grammar so that all modelers were able to catch the intents of the others.

This led us to a sort of "domain-driven software factory", with a fast and 
predicible production line.

The harder lesson to learn has been the underlying rationale of these methods:
make everything explicit, avoid abstractions that domain experts ignore. 

A modeler should never abstract concepts on his own, his code should 
solely express the expert's vision. This was difficult to achieve for us since 
programmers are trained for abstract thinking, but all the abstractions 
introduced without the explicit support of the domain expert led us to very 
subtle and expensive bugs. 

On the opposite, keeping the models down-to-earth and sticking to the target 
business gave us good code that has been reused in different banks.
