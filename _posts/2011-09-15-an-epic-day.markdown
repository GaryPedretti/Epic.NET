I'm glad to announce that the Epic project will be presented to the 
[first italian conference on Domain Driven Design][1], on 8 october in Bologne.

In the talk, I will describe the challenges that lead to the ideation of 
[Epic's architecture][2], its [modeling patterns][3] and the kind of 
projects/products that could gain a lot from them 
(even at this early stage of the development).


My hope is to be able to spread "the Epic dream" to other architects 
and high-skilled developers that could join our journey.

Of course, all the material produced for the conference will be also available here.

See you soon!
