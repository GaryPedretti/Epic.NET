title: We are the Bards...
---

This is a small announcement to signal that we are still alive and we are 
working hard behind the scenes.

I did a deep refactor to the code base to start supporting also a new and 
completely different approach with repositories (without Linq). 
It has been inspired from a new domain that I'm implementing where the search 
criteria defined from the user have a huge value in the business process as 
they represent the customer needs. We will talk about this new step in the 
Epic's road as soon as possibile (answering with the proper deep to a very 
smart mail from Aaron Hawkins).

But this is not the only news: we created a new github organization for the 
Epic project, with the hope that other architects and developers will join our 
adventure (Yes, I'm talking about you!).
We are nerds, you know, and since the project is about Epic, we had no 
choice about the organization name.

A small joke has been born (who asked for a t-shirt?):

We are the [bards][1],
we know the Metric,
we wrote the Epic
of [architards][2].

Ok, now you have a good reason to steer clear of Epic: we are really, really 
nerd! :-D
